Necesito Bartering App
===================================

This app displays lists of vocabulary words for the user to learn the Miwok language.
Used in a Udacity course in the Beginning Android Nanodegree.

Great way to learn how to navigate through multiple Activity views, as well as introducing me to
the concepts of adapters, fragments, and Java class inheritance.


Getting Started
